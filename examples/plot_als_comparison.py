=================================================
Use parametric statistics for group comparison
=================================================

As a contrast to the approach presented in other examples, we also present a
more "standard" statistical approach to analyze tract profile data. Here, we
will conduct a point-by-point group comparison using a linear model fit using
the standard ordinary least squares (OLS) method.

This example first fetches the ALS classification dataset from Sarica et al
[1]_. This dataset contains tractometry features from 24 patients with ALS and
24 demographically matched control subjects. It then uses the statsmodels
library to compare between the tract profiles of the two groups in one
tract (the left corticospinal tract) and in one feature (FA).

# Fetch data from Sarica et al.
# -----------------------------
# As a shortcut, we have incorporated a few studies into the software. In these
# cases, a :class:`AFQDataset` class instance can be initialized using the
# :func:`AFQDataset.from_study` static method. This expects the name of one of
# the studies that are supported (see the method documentation for the list of
# these studies). By passing `"sarica"`, we request that the software download
# the data from this study and initialize an object for us from this data.

afqdata = AFQDataset.from_study("sarica")

# Specify the tracts of interest
# ------------------------------
# Many times we have a specific set of tracts we want to analyze. We can specify
# those tracts using a list with each tract of interest

tracts = ["Left Arcuate", "Right Arcuate", "Left Corticospinal", "Right Corticospinal"]

# Set up plot, run linear models, and show the results
# ----------------------------------------------------
# With the next few lines of code, we fit a linear model in order to predict
# group differences in the diffusion properties of our tracts of interest. The
# function `node_wise_regression` does this by looping through each node of a
# tract and predicting our diffusion metric, in this case FA, as a function of
# group. The initializer `OLS.from_formula` takes `R-style formulas
# <https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/example_formulas.html>`_ as its model specification.
# Here, we are using the `"group"` variable as a categorical variable in the model.
# We can also specify linear-mixed effects models for more complex phenotypic data
# by passing in the appropriate model formula and setting `lme=True`.
#
# Because we conducted 100 comparisons, we need to correct the p-values that
# we obtained for the potential for a false discovery. There are multiple
# ways to conduct multuple comparison correction, and we will not get into
# the considerations in selecting a method here. The function `node_wise_regression`
# uses Benjamini/Hochberg FDR controlling method. This returns a boolean array for
# the p-values that are rejected at a specified alpha level (after correction),
# as well as an array of the corrected p-values.

    col = i % num_cols

    # Visualize
    # ----------
    # We can visualize the results with the `plot_regression_profiles` function.
    # Each subplot shows the tract profiles of the two groups while controlling for
    # any covariates, with stars indicating the nodes at which the null hypothesis is rejected.
